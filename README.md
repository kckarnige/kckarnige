## âœ¨ My Essential Programsâ„¢ âœ¨

### [Oculus Dummy](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusDummy)
It helps squeeze a bit of extra performance out of my gaming laptop.

### [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop)
Literally just the Discord client but smoother and Shiggier. *(You should still try out ArmCord!)*

### [Ecsta](https://github.com/kckarnige/EcstaTab)
Honestly I originally made this for myself, I just like having something nice to look at.

### [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher)
Ever since I've "upgraded" to Windows 11, I've grew slightly fond of it, though I still enjoy the taskbar from Windows 10, and this is perfect!

### [G-Helper](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper)
Lightweight and uses less system resources, meaning 1 MORE FRAME FOR MODDED MINECRAFT BABYYYY WOOOOOOO!!!!

### [Theseus / Modrinth App](https://github.com/modrinth/theseus)
The official Modrinth unofficial Minecraft launcher. Might not be the best fish in the sea, *but it sure is the prettiest :3*
