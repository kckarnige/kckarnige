### üëã Hey, I'm Carnige!

I'm a hobbyist web developer who specialies in nonsensical code and JavaScript! _(sorry for repeating myself)_

## ‚ú® My Essential Programs‚Ñ¢ ‚ú®

### [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop)
Literally just the Discord client but smoother and Shiggier. *(You should still try out ArmCord!)*

Honestly I originally made this for myself, I just like having something nice to look at.

### [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher)
Ever since I've "upgraded" to Windows 11, I've grew slightly fond of it, though I still enjoy the taskbar from Windows 10, and this is perfect!

### [G-Helper](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper)
Lightweight and uses less system resources, meaning 1 MORE FRAME FOR MODDED MINECRAFT BABYYYY WOOOOOOO!!!!

### [Theseus / Modrinth App](https://github.com/modrinth/theseus)
The official Modrinth unofficial Minecraft launcher. Might not be the best fish in the sea, *but it sure is the prettiest :3*
