## ‚ú® My Essential Programs‚Ñ¢ ‚ú®

### [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop)
Literally just the Discord client but smoother and Shiggier. *(You should still try out ArmCord!)*

### [Floorp](https://github.com/floorp-Projects/floorp)
Firefox, but with much more freedom when it comes to customization.

### [Ecsta](https://github.com/kckarnige/EcstaTab)
Honestly I originally made this for myself, I just like having something nice to look at.

### [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher)
Ever since I've "upgraded" to Windows 11, I've grew slightly fond of it, though I still enjoy the taskbar from Windows 10, and this is perfect!

### [G-Helper](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper)
Lightweight and uses less system resources, meaning 1 MORE FRAME FOR MODDED MINECRAFT BABYYYY WOOOOOOO!!!!

### [ATLauncher](https://github.com/ATLauncher/ATLauncher)
The old reliable when it comes to modded Minecraft. Might not be the prettiest, but it just works‚Ñ¢.
