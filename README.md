## ‚ú® My Essential Programs‚Ñ¢ ‚ú®

### [Equibop](https://github.com/Equicord/Equibop)
A fork of [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop), with more plugins. *(You should still try out ~~ArmCord~~ [Legcord](https://github.com/Legcord/Legcord), it includes both Vencord and Equicord!)*

### [Floorp](https://github.com/floorp-Projects/floorp)
A fork of Firefox, but with much more freedom when it comes to customization.

### [Ecsta](https://github.com/kckarnige/EcstaTab)
Honestly, I made this 100% for myself, I just like having something nice to look at.

### [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher)
Ever since I've "upgraded" to Windows 11, though I still enjoy the taskbar and File Explorer from Windows 10, and this is perfect!

### [G-Helper](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper)
A simple and lightweight alternative to ASUS's Armoury Crate, it's a lot more convenient!

### [ATLauncher](https://github.com/ATLauncher/ATLauncher)
The old reliable when it comes to modded Minecraft. Might not be the prettiest, but it just works‚Ñ¢.
