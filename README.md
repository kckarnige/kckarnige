### [Blox R.A.T.](https://github.com/kckarnige/BloxRAT) [P]

### [e694](https://github.com/kckarnige/e694) [P]
A project not too unlike [FxEmbed](https://github.com/FxEmbed/FxEmbed) or [BetterTwitFix](https://github.com/dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix), but for the furry oriented websites e926 and e621.

### [Ecsta](https://github.com/kckarnige/EcstaTab) [P]
An open-source new tab extension that makes for good eye-candy.

### [Fresh NW](https://github.com/kckarnige/NeoNWjsForC2) [P]

### [FUG IGG](https://gist.github.com/kckarnige/6dfff1025b5da69399c26957ee47b445) [P]
Because why wait to install a cryptominer, when you could do it now!!

### [Joe](https://github.com/kckarnige/SoberJoe) [P]
Lost my mind trying to figure out how to start [Sober](https://sober.vinegarhq.org/) from Firefox, so I called up Joe. 

### [Legcord](https://github.com/Legcord/Legcord) [C]
Formerly known as ArmCord. One of the first alternative Discord clients made from scratch, created by smartfridge.

## ✨ My Essential Software™ ✨

### 💫 [Talon](https://github.com/ravendevteam/talon)
A Windows 11 debloater that's as straight forward as using a mouse. 

### [Ecsta](https://github.com/kckarnige/EcstaTab)
Honestly, I made this 100% for myself, I just like having something nice to look at.

### [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord)
A fork of [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord), with more plugins. *(You should still try out ~~ArmCord~~ [Legcord](https://github.com/Legcord/Legcord), it includes both Vencord and Equicord!)*

### [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher)
Ever since I've "upgraded" to Windows 11, though I still enjoy the taskbar and File Explorer from Windows 10, and this is perfect!

### [Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox)
Firefox.

### [G-Helper](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper)
A simple and lightweight alternative to ASUS's Armoury Crate, it's a lot more convenient!

### [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher)
The Minecraft launcher that just works™.

### [Reverse Tethering RePack](https://github.com/Kuijen/RT-RP)
I use Virtual Desktop and wondered if I could use it via USB, then I found this and I'm not going back, it's amazing!
