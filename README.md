### [Blox R.A.T.](https://github.com/kckarnige/BloxRAT) [P]

### [e694](https://github.com/kckarnige/e694) [P]
A project not too unlike [FxEmbed](https://github.com/FxEmbed/FxEmbed) or [BetterTwitFix](https://github.com/dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix), but for the furry oriented websites e926 and e621.

### [Ecsta](https://github.com/kckarnige/EcstaTab) [P]
An open-source new tab extension that makes for good eye-candy.

### [FUG IGG](https://gist.github.com/kckarnige/6dfff1025b5da69399c26957ee47b445) [P]
Because why wait to install a cryptominer, when you could do it now!!

### [Legcord](https://github.com/Legcord/Legcord) [C]

## ‚ú® My Essential Software‚Ñ¢ ‚ú®

### üí´ [ReviOS](https://revi.cc/)
A Windows mod that debloats Windows as much as it can, keeping the look of modern Windows without *being* modern Windows, mostly. 

### [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher)
The Minecraft launcher that just works‚Ñ¢.

### [Ecsta](https://github.com/kckarnige/EcstaTab)
Honestly, I made this 100% for myself, I just like having something nice to look at.

### [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord)
A fork of [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord), with more plugins. *(You should still try out ~~ArmCord~~ [Legcord](https://github.com/Legcord/Legcord), it includes both Vencord and Equicord!)*

### [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher)
Ever since I've "upgraded" to Windows 11, though I still enjoy the taskbar and File Explorer from Windows 10, and this is perfect!

### [Floorp](https://github.com/floorp-Projects/floorp)
A fork of Firefox, but with much more freedom when it comes to customization.

### [G-Helper](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper)
A simple and lightweight alternative to ASUS's Armoury Crate, it's a lot more convenient!

### [Rememory](https://github.com/hpavlo/Rememory)
A clipboard manager I use to replace Window's default clipboard history, because for some reason it doesn't work on my system.    
> *(This may be due to [ReviOS](https://revi.cc/), but I'm not entirely sure since this hasn't been an issue for me in the past.)*

### [Reverse Tethering RePack](https://github.com/Kuijen/RT-RP)
I use Virtual Desktop and wondered if I could use it via USB, then I found this and I'm not going back, it's amazing!
